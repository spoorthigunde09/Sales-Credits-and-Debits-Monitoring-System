# Streamlined Order-to-Cash Management System
I participated in a BI training program. During a group project, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a team member who works in a manufacturing organization. He was particularly impressed with my skills in SQL and Power BI. Recognizing the potential benefits for his company, he approached me after the training to see if I'd be interested in helping him to build a POC for a financial reporting system.Using real company data might not be feasible at this stage due to privacy concerns or the need to simplify the process. Since the project is a POC aiming to showcase the system's functionality, I planned to use fake data in order to show how the system can examine sales, credits, and debits for their company.

Functionality:
The proposed financial reporting system would be designed to analyze and visualize key financial data points like sales, credits, and debits.
Sales: This refers to the revenue generated from selling products or services.
Credits: These are entries that increase a customer's account balance, representing money owed to them.
Debits: These are entries that decrease a customer's account balance, reflecting payments made or money owed by them.
Data Considerations:
Since the project is a POC aiming to showcase the system's functionality, I planned to use fake data. Using real company data might not be feasible at this stage due to privacy concerns or the need to simplify the process. Applied SQL and Power BI Knowledge to build a practical financial reporting system.
Gain real-world experience: This project could provide valuable insights into the needs of a manufacturing company and how BI tools can address them.
Network with a potential collaborator: Building a successful POC could lead to future opportunities working with your teammate's company.

Data Sources:
Multiple daily files are received from distributors and wholesalers. These files likely contain information related to:
Sales data (products sold, quantities, prices)
Credit and debit information (transactions involving customer payments)
Inventory data (stock levels, product availability)
Data Ingestion:
A Lambda function is used to process these daily data files.
Lambda functions are serverless compute services that run code in response to events (in this case, new data files arriving).
Data Transformation:
The Lambda function likely performs some business logic to transform the raw data before storing it. This might involve:
Data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies)
Data mapping (matching fields across different files)
Data aggregation (summarizing sales by product, customer, etc.)
Data Storage:
The transformed data is stored in a Redshift database.
Redshift is a cloud-based data warehouse solution optimized for large datasets and complex analytics.

Positive Aspects of this Project:
This system creates a central repository for sales, credit/debit, and inventory data.The business logic in the Lambda function ensures consistent and reliable data for analysis.Storing data in a data warehouse like Redshift enables efficient querying and analysis of sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management.Redshift and Lambda functions can handle large data volumes and adapt to increasing data needs.

Future Improvements That Might Be Made:
Automation: Scheduled the Lambda function to automatically process data files upon arrival.
Data Visualization: Integrated this data pipeline with data visualization tools to create insightful sales reports and dashboards.
Machine Learning: Used the sales data for customer segmentation, churn prediction, or other predictive analytics.

In summary, this project creates a strong information chain for evaluating distributor and wholesaler sales data. This will offer insightful information that will enhance sales tactics, maximize inventory control, and deepen comprehension of consumer behavior.
